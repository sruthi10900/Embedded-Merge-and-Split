6. Change the dataset visualized by clicking on dataset button at the top.
7. Filter the dataset on specific columns.

## Interactions available in each bar chart

1. Drag any bar of any of the bar chart and merge with any of the other bar of the same bar chart.
2. Drag any bar of any of the bar chart and split it from its existing stack.
3. Drag any bar of any of the bar chart and stack it on top of another bar (Merge and split together) (Extension).

## Interactions available in each bar chart

1. Drag and increase individual bin size of each histogram. Doing this can cause merge of multiple bins.
2. Drag and decrease individual bin size of each histogram. Doing this can cause split of dragged bin.
3. Click on a bar in a histogram to split it at the point we clicked.
4. Drag on the blank space to change number of bins. A larger rectangle in this case means larger bin size, and a smaller rectangle means a smaller bin size

## Interactions available in each matrix plot (Extension)

1. Drag any category on horizontal axis to merge with another category. Result will be a pie chart.
2. Click on a merged category to split it into its components.
3. Hover over individual slice of a pie chart to get a zoomed view of the pie chart as well as details about that slice.
